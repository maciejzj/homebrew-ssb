# Ssb â€“ simple static blogger

A homebrew formula for [ssb](https://github.com/maciejzj/ssb/tree/master) -
a simple static blogger.


## Installation

A POSIX compliant shell is required.

To install run: `brew install maciejzj/ssb/ssb`.

Pandoc is an optional but default dependency as a markdown renderer. You can
install ssb without pandoc by providing extra `--without-pandoc` option to the
brew command.
